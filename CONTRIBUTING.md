# Contributing to RustKernel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RustKernel! This is an educational microkernel project focused on learning ARM64 systems programming with Rust.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Rust toolchain** with nightly features:
   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none
   rustup component add rust-src
   ```

2. **QEMU** for ARM64 emulation:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install qemu
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian  
   apt-get install qemu-system-arm
   ```

3. **Build tools**:
   ```bash
   make check-deps  # Verify all dependencies
   ```

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the kernel
make build

# Run in QEMU
make run

# Debug with GDB
make debug

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Project Architecture

RustKernel follows a microkernel design with these key principles:

- **Minimal kernel**: Only essential functions in kernel space
- **Service-oriented**: OS services run as userspace processes  
- **Memory safety**: Rust ownership prevents memory corruption
- **Hardware isolation**: ARM64 memory protection and privilege levels

## Code Organization

```
kernel/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs           # Kernel entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ boot.s            # ARM64 assembly boot code
â”œâ”€â”€ memory/           # Memory management subsystem
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_allocator.rs  # Physical memory allocation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ paging.rs     # Virtual memory management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mmu.rs        # ARM64 MMU control
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.rs       # Memory testing suite
â”œâ”€â”€ uart.rs           # Console driver
â”œâ”€â”€ devicetree.rs     # Hardware discovery
â”œâ”€â”€ interrupts.rs     # Exception handling
â”œâ”€â”€ process.rs        # Process management
â””â”€â”€ ipc.rs            # Inter-process communication
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Guidelines
- Use `#![no_std]` for kernel code
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over panics for error handling
- Document public APIs with `///` comments
- Use `unsafe` blocks only when necessary and document why
- Follow Rust naming conventions (snake_case, CamelCase, etc.)

### ARM64 Specifics
- Use proper memory barriers (`dsb`, `isb`) for hardware operations
- Align data structures to hardware requirements
- Use volatile operations for memory-mapped I/O
- Comment assembly code thoroughly

### Testing
- Add tests for new memory management features
- Verify allocation/deallocation correctness  
- Include boundary condition testing
- Document expected behavior

## Contribution Process

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustkernel.git
cd rustkernel
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/interrupt-handling
```

### 3. Implement Changes
- Follow the coding standards above
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure `make build` passes without warnings

### 4. Commit Changes
Use conventional commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement ARM64 exception vectors

- Add exception vector table for EL1
- Implement synchronous exception handlers
- Add timer interrupt support
- Include comprehensive testing"
```

### 5. Submit Pull Request
- Describe the changes and motivation
- Reference any related issues
- Include testing instructions
- Request review from maintainers

## Development Areas

### Current Priorities
1. **Interrupt Handling**: ARM64 exception vectors and GIC support
2. **Process Scheduler**: Context switching and round-robin scheduling
3. **System Calls**: Kernel/userspace communication interface
4. **IPC Implementation**: Complete message passing system

### Future Areas
- Device driver framework
- File system support
- Network stack
- Performance optimization

## Testing

### Memory Management Tests
The project includes automated testing for:
- Physical frame allocation/deallocation
- Heap allocation verification
- Statistics validation
- Memory leak detection

### Adding New Tests
```rust
// In kernel/src/memory/test.rs
pub fn test_new_feature() {
    crate::println!("Testing new feature...");
    
    // Test implementation
    assert!(condition, "Test failure message");
    
    crate::println!("âœ“ New feature test passed");
}
```

### Running Tests
Tests run automatically during kernel boot. Check console output for results.
